# Video Asset Required

Please add the planet season morph video to this location:
`/public/video/planet-seasons.mp4`

The video should:
- Loop seamlessly (Moon → Sun → Moon transition)
- Be web-optimized (H.264 codec recommended)
- Have a resolution of 1920x1080 or 1080x1080
- Be muted (no audio track needed)
- Support mobile playback with playsInline attribute

Reference the provided assets:
- `Firefly 3D 360 BLENDER SCENE (SUN–MOON SEASON TRANSITION).mp4`
- `Firefly_Flux_A seamless, loopable cinematic sequence...820135.jpg`

Until the video is added, the app will display a cyan wireframe sphere as a fallback.
